# Folder-Content-Names-To-Text-File

This project is for programmer or designer, who needs the names of the files in a folder, with or without file types.

Basicly the programm search in the images folder for it´s content and saves the names of the files to a text file (result.txt), with a HTML 5 wrapper.

All the source is without a GUI, it's hard-coded. If you want to adapt the code for your purpose, you need a basic understanding of python.

You can go into the test folder to see an example of the result.
